  <p>Merchant: I have a quest for you.</p>
  <p>Continue on down this path, and keep right at the fork.</p>
  <p>Soon you'll find a town. Go to the tavern, and talk to the barkeep.</p>
  <p>Say the word 'internet', and he'll know what it means.</p>
  <p>You: What's an internet?</p>
  <p>Merchant: Idk bro.</p>
  <p>He'll give you a piece of paper. Bring that back to me.</p>
