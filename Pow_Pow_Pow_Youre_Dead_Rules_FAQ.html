        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective is to be the last man standing by "shooting" others with a finger gun and saying "POW POW POW, you're dead" while ensuring they know they have been shot.</p>
        <h2>Execution</h2>
        <p>Approach the target and point your finger gun at them. Clearly say "POW POW POW, you're dead."</p>
        <h2>Awareness</h2>
        <p>The target must reasonably know they have been shot. This means they should be able to see or hear you. Shooting from a distance or whispering does not count if the target is unaware.</p>
        <h2>Speed</h2>
        <p>Say the full phrase quickly. If the target "shoots" back before you finish the phrase, your shot does not count.</p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>Once shot, the target cannot shoot anyone else until the game resets.</p>
        <h2>Reset</h2>
        <p>The game resets every hour on the hour, allowing everyone to play again.</p>
        <h2>Completion</h2>
        <p>You must aim the finger gun and complete the entire phrase for it to count.</p>
        <h2>Ongoing</h2>
        <p>The game can be played at any time, any day, and any place. Strangers can be involved to help "kill" others, but typically you do not involve strangers unless necessary.</p>
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I shoot someone while they are sleeping?</strong><br>
            A: No, the target must be aware that they have been shot.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I use multiple finger guns?</strong><br>
            A: Yes, but you must still say the full phrase "POW POW POW, you're dead" for the shot to count.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: What if someone claims they didn't hear me?</strong><br>
            A: As long as it is reasonable to assume they should have known, the shot counts.</p>
