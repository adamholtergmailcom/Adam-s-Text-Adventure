        <p>Hold onto your hieroglyphics, folks, because we’ve just made the discovery of the millennium. It turns out that the Pyramids of Giza, these architectural marvels that have confounded humanity for thousands of years, are not sitting on the ground as we always believed. Nope. They're on stilts.</p>
        <p>You read that right. Stilts. After centuries of poking around and taking Instagram-worthy pictures from the outside, archaeologists have finally peeled back the desert floor to reveal that the pyramids are essentially standing on glorified ancient table legs, complete with decorative hieroglyphs that, for all we know, might read, “Some Assembly Required.”</p>
        <p>“This is truly groundbreaking,” said Dr. I. M. Serious, head archaeologist on the site. “For years, we assumed the pyramids were solid, majestic, and mysterious. But now, we know they’re just a fancy desert coffee table. This changes everything. We’ll need to update all the textbooks. And maybe get some really big coasters.”</p>
        <p>As it turns out, the ancient Egyptians were not only masters of geometry and astronomy, but they also had a knack for home decor. With these newly-discovered stilt-pillars, they’ve proven themselves to be the ultimate minimalist interior designers. Could this mean they were the inventors of IKEA furniture? The hieroglyphs on the columns are currently being translated, but sources say they might contain step-by-step assembly instructions, likely including a 30-day warranty for ancient wear and tear.</p>
        <p>What’s even more curious is what lies beneath the pillars. Some speculate it's just more sand, but others, including online conspiracy theorists, believe it could be the entrance to a secret underground lounge where Pharaohs held afterlife happy hours. Early translations suggest that one pillar may even read, “No sandals, no service.”</p>
        <p>The full implications of this discovery are still unfolding. Some historians are arguing that if the pyramids were on stilts, perhaps other ancient wonders like Stonehenge or the Colossus of Rhodes were simply ancient DIY projects that have been misunderstood for centuries. “Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if we find a pharaoh’s dusty old toolbox down there,” remarked one researcher. “It's always the tools that outlast the civilization.”</p>
        <p>In any case, this is a day that will go down in history—or at least in the annals of “We Definitely Didn’t See That Coming.” If you’re planning a trip to Egypt, make sure to check out the stilts before the archaeologists cover them back up. And don’t forget to bring your level and tape measure—you never know when you might need it!</p>
